<p>1.1 Basic concepts
What is Statistics?</p>

<p><strong>Statistics</strong> is the study of the collection,organization analysis, interpretation, presentation and orgasim of data.[1] It deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.[1] When analyzing data, it is possible to use one of two statistics methodologies: descriptive statistics or inferential statistics.</p>

<p>Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the population data. Numerical descriptors include mean and standard deviation for continuous data types (like income), while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing categorical data (like race).</p>

<p>When you click the <strong>Knit HTML</strong> button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-r" data-lang="r"><span class="kp">summary</span><span class="p">(</span>cars<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">##      speed           dist    
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 43  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can also embed plots, for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-r" data-lang="r">plot<span class="p">(</span>cars<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
